This is a list of the currently known devices, providing some basic information
on them and how well they work with this project's code, if at all.

At the moment, the code only works with devices using the HID drivers, and will
require some restructuring to work with devices acting like a serial port.
Some of that restructuring is already planned, for other reasons, and the rest
will likely happen sooner or later.

0c45:7401	WORKS
	HID: TEMPerV1.2
	This device has one internal temperature sensor, which appears to be a
	Fairchild FM75 or compatible sensor chip.
	This was the first device owned by EdorFaus, and hence was the first one to
	be supported, and the one having seen the most testing during development.

0c45:7402	WORKS
	HID: TEMPer2HumiV1.x
	Both V1.0 and V1.1 have been seen; V1.1 was confirmed working at 2011-12-28
	in issue #1 after commit b668b00eb16675eba53385edeff6b0a70b38a614.
	This device has one internal temperature and humidity sensor, which appears
	to be a Sensirion SHT1x or compatible sensor chip.
	Read method is the same as TEMPerV1.2, but needs a different formula for
	the temperature.

	USB product strings are the same; device recognition can be done by reading
	from the device (there's an identification byte in a separate data area).
	
	TEMPer	EXPERIMENTAL
		I think this has one internal temperature sensor, as that's what the
		original temper-1.0 code by relevak reads.
		There's some experimental code in this project to read the temperature,
		which might work, but has not yet been confirmed to work.
		The offsets are known, but the code that reads the sensor data is new.
	
	TEMPerHUM	EXPERIMENTAL
		I think this has one internal temperature and humidity sensor; not sure
		whether or not that sensor works like TEMPer2HumiV1.x's sensor.
		There's some experimental code in this project to read the temperature
		and humidity, which might work, but has not yet been confirmed to work.
		The offsets are known, but the code that reads the sensor data is new.
	
	TEMPerNTC	NOT YET
		I think this has one temperature sensor that works differently from
		most of the other temperature sensors; I haven't looked at it yet, but
		do plan to add code for it eventually.
