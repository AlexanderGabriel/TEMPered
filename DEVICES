This is a list of the currently known devices, providing some basic information
on them and how well they work with this project's code, if at all.

At the moment, the code only works with devices using the HID drivers, and will
require some restructuring to work with devices acting like a serial port.
Some of that restructuring is already planned, for other reasons, and the rest
will likely happen sooner or later.

0c45:7401	WORKS
	HID: TEMPerV1.2
	This device has one internal temperature sensor, which appears to be a
	Fairchild FM75 or compatible sensor chip.
	This was the first device owned by EdorFaus, and hence was the first one to
	be supported, and the one having seen the most testing during development.

0c45:7402	WORKS
	HID: TEMPer2HumiV1.x
	Both V1.0 and V1.1 have been seen; V1.1 was confirmed working at 2011-12-28
	in issue #1 after commit b668b00eb16675eba53385edeff6b0a70b38a614.
	This device has one internal temperature and humidity sensor, which appears
	to be a Sensirion SHT1x or compatible sensor chip.
	Read method is the same as TEMPerV1.2, but needs a different formula for
	the temperature.

	HID
	USB product strings are the same; device recognition can be done by reading
	from the device (there's an identification byte in a separate data area).
	
	TEMPer	EXPERIMENTAL
		I think this has one internal temperature sensor, as that's what the
		original temper-1.0 code by relevak reads.
		There's some experimental code in this project to read the temperature,
		which might work, but has not yet been confirmed to work.
		The offsets are known, but the code that reads the sensor data is new.
	
	TEMPerHUM	EXPERIMENTAL
		I think this has one internal temperature and humidity sensor; not sure
		whether or not that sensor works like TEMPer2HumiV1.x's sensor.
		There's some experimental code in this project to read the temperature
		and humidity, which might work, but has not yet been confirmed to work.
		The offsets are known, but the code that reads the sensor data is new.
	
	TEMPerNTC	NOT YET
		I think this has one temperature sensor that works differently from
		most of the other temperature sensors; I haven't looked at it yet, but
		do plan to add code for it eventually.

?:?	NOT YET
	serial: TEMPer232
	USB IDs unknown, apparently uses the ch341 kernel driver; some docs are
	supposedly available, I haven't seen them (nor looked for them).
	I've only seen it mentioned in relevak's thread, which also has mentions
	of it being problematic.
	Requires some restructuring for the code to work with serial devices.

1a86:7523	NOT YET
	serial: TEMPer16
	Uses the ch341 kernel driver.
	Has two channels (A/B) of up to 8 temperature sensors each (Tx aka T0-T7),
	for a total of up to 16 temperature sensors. Product images suggests these
	temperature sensors are the same type as that of TemperNTC. Uses wires with
	standard 3.5mm audio connectors to connect the sensors, probably using the
	1wire protocol; I'm guessing it contains two 1wire bus chips, and addresses
	the sensors individually when reading.
	Requires some restructuring for the code to work with serial devices, and
	for the number of sensors only being known after device initialization.
	Theoretically, the number of sensors can change at any time, as can which
	ones are connected, but I'm not so sure we want to allow that in practice,
	since it can be easily done by reopening the device. An alternative would
	be to always say 16 sensors, and simply fail the reading of ones that
	aren't currently connected - assuming that works in practice (it might).
	That would move the management of this to the users of the library.
