This project started as the idea of combining the various programs and
libraries for reading the TEMPer thermometer devices into one general library
that could read them all, providing a unified interface to applications.

This is, of course, complicated by the fact that I currently only have one
variant of those devices myself, namely the TEMPerV1.2 USB HID device.

On the way, I realized that, at least the program[1] that works for the device
I actually have, basically implements the HID standard, because it's based on
replicating what is seen with USB sniffing.

To avoid this, I looked for a HID library, and found HIDAPI[2], which in
addition to being open source is also cross-platform, which is positive.

This enabled me to fairly quickly make a much simpler program than the original
that does basically the same thing, namely read the temperature off the sensor.

Since then, I've been changing and adding to the code, to make the various
device variants work as well as I can, and intend to continue doing that.
See the DEVICES file for more information on the currently known devices and
how well they work (if at all).


As yet, this is as far as I have gotten - which includes these programs:
- enumerate: lists the devices attached to the system, -a includes unknown ones
- temperhid: reads the temperature off either all found devices, or those given
- dump-data: reads the data off the same devices as temperhid, and dumps it in
    raw format, which can be useful for debugging and adding new device support


I have not yet implemented all the features of Cray's pcsensor program,
and may not get around to doing that for quite a while, as I don't need them.


To build the programs, first clone both this and HIDAPI[2], then build HIDAPI
for your platform (I mostly use the Linux/hidraw implementation), then adjust
the path in the Makefile (if necessary) to point to the built HIDAPI source,
then run make.

For this to work properly, you will probably need to have installed the -dev
packages for libudev and/or libusb first (for the right library versions).
