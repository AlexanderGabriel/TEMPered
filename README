This project started as the idea of combining the various programs and
libraries for reading the TEMPer thermometer devices into one general library
that could read them all, providing a unified interface to applications.

This is, of course, complicated by the fact that I currently only have one
variant of those devices myself, namely the TEMPerV1.2 USB HID device.

On the way, I realized that, at least the program[1] that works for the device
I actually have, basically implements the HID standard, because it's based on
replicating what is seen with USB sniffing.

To avoid this, I looked for a HID library, and found HIDAPI, which in addition
to being open source is also cross-platform, which is positive.

This enabled me to fairly quickly make a much simpler program than the original
that does basically the same thing, namely read the temperature off the sensor.

As yet, this is as far as I have gotten - there's currently just a pair of
programs, one that enumerates the devices attached to the system, and one that
reads the temperature off either all supported devices, or the specified ones.

I have not yet implemented all the features of Cray's pcsensor program though,
and may not get around to doing that for quite a while, as I don't need them.



[1] The program I'm talking about is called pcsensor-1.0.0, by Cray, seen here:
