This project is a C implementation of a library and program to read all the
various types of TEMPer thermometer and hygrometer USB devices, as produced by
RDing Technology and sold under the name PCsensor.

This is, of course, complicated by the fact that I currently only have one
variant of those devices myself, namely the TEMPerV1.2 USB HID device, and by
them creating a whole bunch of technically different devices under the same
names - yet often reusing the same hardware (including USB IDs) for different
devices with different features.

Hence, only a few of the devices are currently supported, but I'm working to
add support for as many as I can, as quickly as I can. I will need help here.

See the DEVICES file for more information on the currently known devices and
how well they work (if at all).


In addition to the library itself, this project includes these utilities:
- enumerate: lists the recognized devices attached to the system
- tempered : reads the sensors of either all found devices, or those specified
    as parameters, and prints the readings to standard output.
- hid-query: sends an arbitrary query to a user-specified HID device, and
    prints the returned result as hex bytes. This is mostly useful when adding
    support for new devices or during debugging, and can be a little dangerous.


To build the programs, first clone both this and HIDAPI[1], then build HIDAPI
for your platform (I mostly use the Linux/hidraw implementation), then adjust
the path in the Makefile (if necessary) to point to the built HIDAPI source,
then run make.

For this to work properly, you will probably need to have installed the -dev
packages for libudev and/or libusb first (for the right library versions).
